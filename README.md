# go-whosonfirst-database

Go package implementing common properties and methods for working with Who's On First databases.

## Documentation

Documentation is incomplete at this time.

## Motivation

The goal is for this package to replace the `whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-sqlite*` packages. Everything works but there are still details to be finalized.

## sfomuseum/go-database

Under the hood this package makes extensive use of the [sfomuseum/go-database](https://github.com/sfomuseum/go-database/) package to provide common interfaces for (SQL) database tables and to provide a variety of helper methods.
