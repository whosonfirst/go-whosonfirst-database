# database/sql

This package provides common `database/sql` related interfaces and method for working with Who's On First documents.

It does NOT load any specific `database/sql` drivers by default, though. That is expected to happen in separate `whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-database-{DATABASE}` packages.
